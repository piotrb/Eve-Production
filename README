Goal/Description:

Try to automate a bit of the spreadsheets involved in Eve Online.

The idea is to get prices of materials at diffrent locations into the system (manually)

And then have the system figure out what should be bought from where and what should be made.

Essentially you'd get a shopping list and a production list.

Right now this includes a data browser, with a bit of code that can take an eve mysql dump and convert it to a more "code friendly" version
making things mode db agnostic.

This originally was rails 3+mysql, now its 3.1 + pg set up to work on heroku.
